    <strong>Plex to Cache</strong> automatically optimizes your Unraid storage by moving media files from the array to your cache drive as soon as playback starts. This reduces array spin-ups, enhances performance, and includes features like smart cleanup and ahead-of-time caching for your favorite media servers (Plex, Emby, Jellyfin).
